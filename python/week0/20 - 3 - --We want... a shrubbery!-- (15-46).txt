[MUSIC]. 
Well, welcome to the end of week zero. 
for each week, I'll create a video for 
the week's mini project. 
And I'll walk you through the details of 
how to create that mini project. 
Most of the mini projects will be between 
50 to 150 lines of Python code. 
However, the first mini project we're 
going to do is going to be very easy. 
It's just one line of Python code. 
And it's really designed to help you 
learn how to create, submit and peer 
evaluate your mini projects. 
It's totally optional. 
If you feel confident, you can follow 
instructions, feel free to skip this. 
If you think it's silly, feel free to 
skip it. 
before I go onto there though, I'm going 
to answer two important questions. 
First, why would anybody name a computer 
lang, language after a giant snake? 
It's Python. 
Everybody says, well what's Python? 
It's a snake. 
Well, no, it's named after something 
different. 
It's named after Monty Python's Flying 
Circus. 
So, Monty Python's Flying Circus is a 
British comedy troupe. 
And there's a kind of a, a tradition in 
the Python community to have inside 
references to material from Monty 
Python's skits and movies. 
our project is based on inside reference 
to the movie, Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail. 
And they're knights of King Arthur, 
members of the Python comedy troupe, and 
they go out and interact with the Knights 
Who Say Ni. 
And I'll let you kind of dig around on 
the web, if you want to find out more 
information. 
But the phrase, we want a shrubbery, 
comes up in that particular scene. 
the second question that you might 
want to ask is who's this? 
This is Sir Loin. 
I'm the chair of the Department of 
Computer Science here at Rice and I 
inherited Sir Loin. 
This is really his name. 
I was told specifically this is his name. 
Five years ago, whenever I took over as 
chair. 
And for five years he's set here and I 
have no clue what to do with him. 
So, I decided for this video, what the 
heck. 
He'll be my co-host. 
And actually, he'll weigh on in, weigh in 
on an important topic later in this 
video. 
So anyways, let's go out now and get 
serious and we'll talk about how to 
create, submit and peer assess your mini 
projects. 
All right, let's walk through the process 
of creating, submitting and peer assesing 
your mini project. 
So, we'll start here at the main class 
page. 
Over here, we have the Nav bar, which has 
all the entries for various class 
material and activities. 
And now, the three most important ones 
are Video Lectures, Quizzes and 
Mini-projects. 
So, kind of at the start of each week, go 
out here, you'll click on Mini-projects 
and you'll see here, it's kind of an 
overview of how the process works for 
submitting and assessing a mini-project. 
And at the bottom, you'll see the links 
for the various mini-projects you have 
waiting. 
So, here, for example, we have two 
current mini-projects out. 
This is the one for the end of week zero. 
We want a shrubbery, that's optional. 
You don't have to turn it in, just there 
for you to figure out how peer assessment 
works. 
And the second one, this is the one 
you're going to turn in, it's the end of 
week one. 
It'll be Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-Spock. 
Now, kind of, one of the things that 
comes up is when are these due? 
So, we have one uniform time for the 
entire class when everything is due, 
quizzes, mini-projects, everything. 
And that is 0500 Greenwich Median Time. 
Now, because everybody works on their own 
local time, you've got to figure out when 
is that for you. 
So, Coursera, Coursera has has support 
for this. 
So, the first thing I want you to do, is 
go up to your Settings. 
Up here, pull down, and make sure your 
Timezone is set correctly. 
So, I'm in the Chicago timezone. 
So, I'm actually in Houston, so 
everything is fine there. 
And now, you can pull down here. 
And you can see that it says, well 
everything is due midnight Saturday in 
Houston. 
So, that's actually 500 Greenwich Median 
Time. 
And if you pull this button over, you can 
actually see kind of the time dates for 
both submission, peer assessment, and 
then getting back the results. 
So, you're going to have about three and 
a half days to do peer assessment in 
there. 
so my kind of suggestion is, since it's 
going to due in the middle of the weekend 
on a middle of the weekend, my suggestion 
is start early. 
And then, you've got Saturday to kind of 
work on doing the current week's 
assignment. 
And then, you can kind of take a glance 
at the upcoming weeks assignment when 
it's released. 
Okay. 
Let's go on and we'll look at the 
specific assignment. 
Okay, let's go walk through building your 
first mini-project. 
So, we'll go to this page, we'll say, 
click Go To Assignment. 
And, actually, up pops the webpage for 
the assignment. 
At the top, you can see kind of three 
button, three things here. 
These correspond to the submission phase, 
which is we're in right now. 
There'll be a peer evaluation phase. 
And there'll be a phase where you see the 
results. 
So, I'm actually recording this video 
well before class starts. 
We scroll down here, we'll see kind of 
the start of descriptions of the 
mini-project. 
the main thing in this particular 
mini-project is to walk through the 
logistics side. 
A fairly detailed description of exactly 
what we're talking about. 
One thing to note here is that the 
mini-project is always released at 0500 
Greenwich Mean Time on a Saturday 
morning. 
So, that means you have exactly eight 
days to work on your mini-projects. 
So, if you get done early, you have an 
entire weekend to work on it. 
You have the following week, and you have 
another day there. 
So, If you work very effectively, you 
have a good bit of time to work on the 
mini-projects. 
if you scroll on down, you see kind of 
the rest of what we're going to talk 
about here. 
One thing to note here is we have a save 
service available for CodeSkulptor. 
For some reason, save doesn't work in 
CodeSkulptor. 
We've had that occasion with students 
from some countries that block access to 
Google storage. 
You can use this link and have another 
route in to actually generate a 
CodeSculptor URL that you can submit for 
your mini-project. 
let's scroll on down. 
For most of your assignments, this will 
be kind of the meat of what you'll see. 
You'll see a little introduction. 
And then, you'll see what I'm going to 
refer to as a mini-project development 
process. 
And that's going to be very detailed. 
It's going to walk you through how to 
build your mini-project step by step. 
It's important you read it. 
To help you get through these 
mini-projects, we are going to give you 
very detailed advice and recommendations. 
I had way too many students in previous 
sessions of the class ignore this and 
say, I can do it on my own. 
And then, at the end, they get stuck, and 
they come say, oh my gosh, what's going 
on. 
I can't do this. 
I ask, did you follow the development 
process, and they go no. 
So, use this, it's here to help you. 
and then, the second thing I want to 
point out is that there's a grading 
rubric attached to this. 
So, as you're working on the project, 
we'll tell you exactly what your project 
needs to do. 
You're going to have questions such as, 
does my project need to do x? 
Well, look at the grading rubric. 
The grading rubric is going to have 
there, have a, on this case, probably 
about 15 to 25 items that will determine 
whether your project works correctly or 
not. 
And they're going to be very small part, 
either you get a point or you won't. 
So, for example, down here, one of rubric 
items says the program prints a message 
in the console. 
Okay, if your program does it, you get a 
point. 
If your program doesn't, you won't. 
so go through and take a look at this. 
when you're actually ready to start 
working on your mini-project. 
Where it's going to provide you with a 
program template. 
And then, it will be a CodeSkulptor file 
that you can start from, that provides 
kind of a code base for getting working 
on your project. 
Currently, any mini-projects, it's not so 
critical. 
You can probably do it from scratch. 
But when you start working on some of the 
projects later in the class, we're going 
to give you a lot of useful things. 
For example, when you do rice rocks at 
the end of the class, we're going to give 
you all the art and sound assets. 
So, that template's going to contain 
information about how to get your hands 
on this. 
So, we'll just go through and do this 
mini-project really quickly. 
So, I'm going to click on this, and up 
popped CodeSkulptor and what we see here. 
You know, here's CodeSkulptor, we got 
some comments. 
But most importantly, here we see, print 
hello world. 
So, this mini-project is really easy, we 
just have to change this to print. 
We want a shrubbery, so let's do that. 
[SOUND] Now, let's not forget our dots, a 
shrubbery. 
Let's run it really quick, looks pretty 
good. 
We can go back here and let's take a peek 
at the grading rubric again. 
Same number of dots. 
Looks pretty good. 
So, let's go into CodeSkulptor. 
Now, we can hit Save. 
And notice now, it generated a fresh 
CodeSkulptor URL here. 
So, this is unique for your particular 
solution. 
So now, when we're ready to submit this, 
all we do is the following. 
You select the URL. 
Ctrl+C to copy, we go down and we Paste 
it in this box. 
That's all you do. 
You don't cut and paste a version of your 
program in here. 
Cutting and pasting entire pieces of 
programs is very tricky. 
What happens is if somebody who's 
creating your project actually doesn't 
get an entire project? 
Your'e going to be upset. 
So, the critical thing here is only 
submit a CodeSkulptor URL, don't submit 
your program in here. 
When you're happy with it, click the 
Honor Code button. 
Notice what that did. 
That actually highlighted this button, 
Submit for grading. 
Okay. 
So, a lot of the time I see people say, I 
can't figure out how to submit it. 
This button, yeah, this button isn't 
highlighted for me. 
You have to click this box that says, I 
agree to the honor code. 
When you're ready to submit it for 
grading, click Submit for grading. 
And there it is. 
We've now submitted your, submitted your 
code for grading. 
So, a couple things about submission. 
if you decide, wow, you know, I submitted 
it early and I wanted to go back and work 
on it some more because I realized it was 
a mistake or I was a little bit, kind of 
worried I was going to get it done in 
time. 
It's perfectly fine to cut an paste a new 
URL in your corresponding to a new 
assignment and resubmit it. 
There's no penalty for submitting as much 
as you want. 
If you're getting close to the deadline 
and you think, oh man, the deadline 
passed,Coursera has a very, very generous 
policy on late submission. 
There's a great grace period. 
So, if you're a couple of minutes past 
the deadline, don't panic. 
Just go through and submit it. 
I think most of the time, you've got a, 
you've got a fair bit of time to do it. 
I want to emphasize one thing. 
You have to click the Submit button. 
If you click Save, your project will not 
be submitted for grading. 
Saving your project does not get it 
submitted for, for grading in pure 
assessment. 
This is probably the biggest thing I can 
say with this one video. 
Click Submit. 
If you don't click Submit, you'll be very 
sad when you find out that you're not 
going to be able to do peer assessment 
and get your own project assessed by your 
peers. 
Hit Submit. 
Okay. 
Now, let's go out and take a look at peer 
assessment. 
Okay, let's walk through the process of 
peer evaluation. 
So, an hour after the mini-project is 
due, the peer assessment page is open. 
And so, if you go back to assignment 
page, this tab will be active. 
And in particular, if you click on this 
link, you'll be directed to five pages, 
one with one for each of five of your 
peers. 
Your job would to be go through and take 
those peers projects and assess them 
based on the grading rubic that we 
provided. 
You'll then, be asked to evaluate your 
own project and do self assessment. 
So, if we scroll down, we're actually 
working on the first student. 
Now, because this is before we've 
actually started peer evaluations, this 
box is empty, but this box will contain 
the URL for your peer's assignment. 
below, we'll have kind of a form that 
you'll need to do to actually do the 
evaluation. 
We'll ask you two questions to start. 
What kind of operating system does your 
computer have and what kind of browser 
did you use, in case there's some issue 
with some of the, how your peer 
assessment actually came out. 
here are the grading instructions. 
And this essentially kind of leads into 
the four rubric items we talked about. 
This is here, the first rubric item. 
If we submit a valid CodeSkulptor URL, 
and then we have some options for this, 
and then we have a place to submit some 
comments. 
So, actually, let's go through and do it. 
I actually have a URL, so I'm sitting 
here in CodeSkulptor, I'm going to paste 
it in. 
And let's hit Enter. 
And sure enough, up comes the project we 
just did, that we just created. 
So, it looks like that's a valid 
CodeSkulptor URL. 
So, I'm going to go through here and say 
1. 
And because it worked, I'm not going to 
put any comments in. 
See, running the program does not throw 
an error. 
Let's do that. 
So, I'll run it. 
No errors, looks good. 
Let's go back and give them a 1. 
Keep going. 
It says prints a message in the console. 
Yeah, printed a message in the console, 
good job. 
Okay. 
Let's keep going down. 
Last, prints the following message, we 
want a shrubbery. 
Okay. 
Well, let's see, run it again. 
We got, we want dot, dot, dot a shrubery. 
Hmm, uh-oh, wait a misspelled shrubbery. 
Hmm, let's go back. 
It says, we want a shrubbery. 
It says, prints the specified message. 
Now, if you were having this machine 
graded, you'd be out of luck. 
But we're using humans. 
So, humans have the ability to make 
judgments. 
And one of the judgments is that, that 
your peers satisfy the spirit of this 
rubric eye. 
Remember, we're all here to learn. 
So, I'm going to ask Sir Loin. 
Sir Loin, did they need the spirit of 
this rubric item? 
Well, Sir Loin being part of King 
Arthur's round table as merciful? 
And he says yes, he did. 
So, I'm going to give him full credit. 
But, I'm going to make a note here that 
you misspelled shrubbery. 
It's always good if you're, either 
there's an issue or you take off points 
to add a comment here. 
Just think how it is. 
It's very frustrating if you get points 
marked off of your project and there's no 
reason given. 
So, take a few seconds and put in a 
message here, if there's some issue with 
the project on a particular item. 
then you get a chance to get some overall 
feedback here. 
Remember, this should be positive. 
Your goal is not to make your peers feel 
bad. 
It's to give helpful advice. 
you did a great job inside, outside of 
spelling. 
There you go. 
And this point now, you can submit your 
evaluation. 
Once you've done that, Coursera will prop 
you, prompt you to go off and do four 
more students, and do this same process 
of filling in forms. 
For most mini-projects, it should take at 
most an hour. 
You spend maybe 10 minutes on each one. 
That gives you, basically you have to do 
five of your peers, and then you have to 
do yourself. 
That's about an hour worth of work. 
the better job you do, hopefully your 
peers will do a good job on your project. 
One caveat. 
You gotta hit Submit. 
You can't get to the next projects until 
you hit Submit. 
So doing your peers is usually pretty 
easy, people don't mess that up. 
But you're in a hurry to get finished, 
and you're doing a self assessment and 
you forget to hit Submit. 
What happens? 
Well, Coursera says you didn't do your 
self assessment. 
And the way the grading is setup and we 
can't change this, this is Course, this 
is the way Coursera works, is you get a 
20% fiddle if you fail to do peer 
assessment or self assessment. 
So, please, remember to hit Submit. 
It's painful to lose 20% of your hard 
earned grade because you forget to hit 
Submit evaluation. 
Okay, go out there and give it a crack, 
our work through logistics. 
This isn't for a grade, so this is your 
chance to make some errors and learn how 
to do it correctly next week when we do 
rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. 
Okay, see you then.
