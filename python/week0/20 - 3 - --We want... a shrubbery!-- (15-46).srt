1
00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:07,587
[MUSIC]. 

2
00:00:07,587 --> 00:00:12,271
Well, welcome to the end of week zero. 
for each week, I'll create a video for 

3
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:16,198
the week's mini project. 
And I'll walk you through the details of 

4
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:20,670
how to create that mini project. 
Most of the mini projects will be between 

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,88
50 to 150 lines of Python code. 
However, the first mini project we're 

6
00:00:25,88 --> 00:00:29,96
going to do is going to be very easy. 
It's just one line of Python code. 

7
00:00:29,96 --> 00:00:33,236
And it's really designed to help you 
learn how to create, submit and peer 

8
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:37,210
evaluate your mini projects. 
It's totally optional. 

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,260
If you feel confident, you can follow 
instructions, feel free to skip this. 

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,780
If you think it's silly, feel free to 
skip it. 

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,46
before I go onto there though, I'm going 
to answer two important questions. 

12
00:00:47,46 --> 00:00:53,104
First, why would anybody name a computer 
lang, language after a giant snake? 

13
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:55,720
It's Python. 
Everybody says, well what's Python? 

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,895
It's a snake. 
Well, no, it's named after something 

15
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,749
different. 
It's named after Monty Python's Flying 

16
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:05,965
Circus. 
So, Monty Python's Flying Circus is a 

17
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:10,697
British comedy troupe. 
And there's a kind of a, a tradition in 

18
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:15,122
the Python community to have inside 
references to material from Monty 

19
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:21,151
Python's skits and movies. 
our project is based on inside reference 

20
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:25,540
to the movie, Monty Python and the Holy 
Grail. 

21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,932
And they're knights of King Arthur, 
members of the Python comedy troupe, and 

22
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:32,530
they go out and interact with the Knights 
Who Say Ni. 

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,831
And I'll let you kind of dig around on 
the web, if you want to find out more 

24
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:37,890
information. 
But the phrase, we want a shrubbery, 

25
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,422
comes up in that particular scene. 
the second question that you might 

26
00:01:42,422 --> 00:01:46,950
want to ask is who's this? 
This is Sir Loin. 

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,629
I'm the chair of the Department of 
Computer Science here at Rice and I 

28
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,30
inherited Sir Loin. 
This is really his name. 

29
00:01:52,30 --> 00:01:55,495
I was told specifically this is his name. 
Five years ago, whenever I took over as 

30
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,762
chair. 
And for five years he's set here and I 

31
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:01,335
have no clue what to do with him. 
So, I decided for this video, what the 

32
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:03,760
heck. 
He'll be my co-host. 

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,973
And actually, he'll weigh on in, weigh in 
on an important topic later in this 

34
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,667
video. 
So anyways, let's go out now and get 

35
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:13,6
serious and we'll talk about how to 
create, submit and peer assess your mini 

36
00:02:13,6 --> 00:02:19,178
projects. 
All right, let's walk through the process 

37
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:27,780
of creating, submitting and peer assesing 
your mini project. 

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,670
So, we'll start here at the main class 
page. 

39
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,903
Over here, we have the Nav bar, which has 
all the entries for various class 

40
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,775
material and activities. 
And now, the three most important ones 

41
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,756
are Video Lectures, Quizzes and 
Mini-projects. 

42
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:44,518
So, kind of at the start of each week, go 
out here, you'll click on Mini-projects 

43
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:47,938
and you'll see here, it's kind of an 
overview of how the process works for 

44
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:53,616
submitting and assessing a mini-project. 
And at the bottom, you'll see the links 

45
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:56,450
for the various mini-projects you have 
waiting. 

46
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,20
So, here, for example, we have two 
current mini-projects out. 

47
00:03:00,20 --> 00:03:03,370
This is the one for the end of week zero. 
We want a shrubbery, that's optional. 

48
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,538
You don't have to turn it in, just there 
for you to figure out how peer assessment 

49
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:08,700
works. 
And the second one, this is the one 

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,630
you're going to turn in, it's the end of 
week one. 

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,764
It'll be Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-Spock. 
Now, kind of, one of the things that 

52
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:18,443
comes up is when are these due? 
So, we have one uniform time for the 

53
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:24,620
entire class when everything is due, 
quizzes, mini-projects, everything. 

54
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,308
And that is 0500 Greenwich Median Time. 
Now, because everybody works on their own 

55
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:34,280
local time, you've got to figure out when 
is that for you. 

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,510
So, Coursera, Coursera has has support 
for this. 

57
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,540
So, the first thing I want you to do, is 
go up to your Settings. 

58
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,500
Up here, pull down, and make sure your 
Timezone is set correctly. 

59
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,524
So, I'm in the Chicago timezone. 
So, I'm actually in Houston, so 

60
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:52,370
everything is fine there. 
And now, you can pull down here. 

61
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,50
And you can see that it says, well 
everything is due midnight Saturday in 

62
00:03:57,50 --> 00:04:01,15
Houston. 
So, that's actually 500 Greenwich Median 

63
00:04:01,15 --> 00:04:03,726
Time. 
And if you pull this button over, you can 

64
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:07,626
actually see kind of the time dates for 
both submission, peer assessment, and 

65
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:12,348
then getting back the results. 
So, you're going to have about three and 

66
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:14,780
a half days to do peer assessment in 
there. 

67
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,656
so my kind of suggestion is, since it's 
going to due in the middle of the weekend 

68
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:23,49
on a middle of the weekend, my suggestion 
is start early. 

69
00:04:23,49 --> 00:04:26,235
And then, you've got Saturday to kind of 
work on doing the current week's 

70
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:29,77
assignment. 
And then, you can kind of take a glance 

71
00:04:29,77 --> 00:04:32,208
at the upcoming weeks assignment when 
it's released. 

72
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,34
Okay. 
Let's go on and we'll look at the 

73
00:04:35,34 --> 00:04:41,629
specific assignment. 
Okay, let's go walk through building your 

74
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:46,270
first mini-project. 
So, we'll go to this page, we'll say, 

75
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,883
click Go To Assignment. 
And, actually, up pops the webpage for 

76
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:54,953
the assignment. 
At the top, you can see kind of three 

77
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,932
button, three things here. 
These correspond to the submission phase, 

78
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,881
which is we're in right now. 
There'll be a peer evaluation phase. 

79
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,160
And there'll be a phase where you see the 
results. 

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,40
So, I'm actually recording this video 
well before class starts. 

81
00:05:08,40 --> 00:05:10,708
We scroll down here, we'll see kind of 
the start of descriptions of the 

82
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,739
mini-project. 
the main thing in this particular 

83
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:16,20
mini-project is to walk through the 
logistics side. 

84
00:05:16,20 --> 00:05:19,210
A fairly detailed description of exactly 
what we're talking about. 

85
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,480
One thing to note here is that the 
mini-project is always released at 0500 

86
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,460
Greenwich Mean Time on a Saturday 
morning. 

87
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,760
So, that means you have exactly eight 
days to work on your mini-projects. 

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,828
So, if you get done early, you have an 
entire weekend to work on it. 

89
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:36,516
You have the following week, and you have 
another day there. 

90
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:39,36
So, If you work very effectively, you 
have a good bit of time to work on the 

91
00:05:39,36 --> 00:05:41,585
mini-projects. 
if you scroll on down, you see kind of 

92
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:43,730
the rest of what we're going to talk 
about here. 

93
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,60
One thing to note here is we have a save 
service available for CodeSkulptor. 

94
00:05:47,60 --> 00:05:49,930
For some reason, save doesn't work in 
CodeSkulptor. 

95
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,230
We've had that occasion with students 
from some countries that block access to 

96
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,871
Google storage. 
You can use this link and have another 

97
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:01,131
route in to actually generate a 
CodeSculptor URL that you can submit for 

98
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:04,970
your mini-project. 
let's scroll on down. 

99
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,804
For most of your assignments, this will 
be kind of the meat of what you'll see. 

100
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:11,401
You'll see a little introduction. 
And then, you'll see what I'm going to 

101
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:14,590
refer to as a mini-project development 
process. 

102
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,840
And that's going to be very detailed. 
It's going to walk you through how to 

103
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,370
build your mini-project step by step. 
It's important you read it. 

104
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,175
To help you get through these 
mini-projects, we are going to give you 

105
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:29,664
very detailed advice and recommendations. 
I had way too many students in previous 

106
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:32,431
sessions of the class ignore this and 
say, I can do it on my own. 

107
00:06:32,431 --> 00:06:34,836
And then, at the end, they get stuck, and 
they come say, oh my gosh, what's going 

108
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:36,970
on. 
I can't do this. 

109
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,200
I ask, did you follow the development 
process, and they go no. 

110
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,798
So, use this, it's here to help you. 
and then, the second thing I want to 

111
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:47,880
point out is that there's a grading 
rubric attached to this. 

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,390
So, as you're working on the project, 
we'll tell you exactly what your project 

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,997
needs to do. 
You're going to have questions such as, 

114
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,190
does my project need to do x? 
Well, look at the grading rubric. 

115
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,206
The grading rubric is going to have 
there, have a, on this case, probably 

116
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:03,690
about 15 to 25 items that will determine 
whether your project works correctly or 

117
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,40
not. 
And they're going to be very small part, 

118
00:07:07,40 --> 00:07:11,296
either you get a point or you won't. 
So, for example, down here, one of rubric 

119
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:14,724
items says the program prints a message 
in the console. 

120
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,930
Okay, if your program does it, you get a 
point. 

121
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,119
If your program doesn't, you won't. 
so go through and take a look at this. 

122
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,890
when you're actually ready to start 
working on your mini-project. 

123
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,810
Where it's going to provide you with a 
program template. 

124
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,60
And then, it will be a CodeSkulptor file 
that you can start from, that provides 

125
00:07:31,60 --> 00:07:34,670
kind of a code base for getting working 
on your project. 

126
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,340
Currently, any mini-projects, it's not so 
critical. 

127
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,84
You can probably do it from scratch. 
But when you start working on some of the 

128
00:07:40,84 --> 00:07:43,410
projects later in the class, we're going 
to give you a lot of useful things. 

129
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,418
For example, when you do rice rocks at 
the end of the class, we're going to give 

130
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:50,835
you all the art and sound assets. 
So, that template's going to contain 

131
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:53,820
information about how to get your hands 
on this. 

132
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,320
So, we'll just go through and do this 
mini-project really quickly. 

133
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,200
So, I'm going to click on this, and up 
popped CodeSkulptor and what we see here. 

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,134
You know, here's CodeSkulptor, we got 
some comments. 

135
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:05,30
But most importantly, here we see, print 
hello world. 

136
00:08:05,30 --> 00:08:09,70
So, this mini-project is really easy, we 
just have to change this to print. 

137
00:08:09,70 --> 00:08:18,526
We want a shrubbery, so let's do that. 
[SOUND] Now, let's not forget our dots, a 

138
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:24,656
shrubbery. 
Let's run it really quick, looks pretty 

139
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:27,732
good. 
We can go back here and let's take a peek 

140
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:32,160
at the grading rubric again. 
Same number of dots. 

141
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,770
Looks pretty good. 
So, let's go into CodeSkulptor. 

142
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,410
Now, we can hit Save. 
And notice now, it generated a fresh 

143
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,418
CodeSkulptor URL here. 
So, this is unique for your particular 

144
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:45,720
solution. 
So now, when we're ready to submit this, 

145
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,740
all we do is the following. 
You select the URL. 

146
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:57,820
Ctrl+C to copy, we go down and we Paste 
it in this box. 

147
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,562
That's all you do. 
You don't cut and paste a version of your 

148
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:03,832
program in here. 
Cutting and pasting entire pieces of 

149
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:06,606
programs is very tricky. 
What happens is if somebody who's 

150
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,478
creating your project actually doesn't 
get an entire project? 

151
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:12,234
Your'e going to be upset. 
So, the critical thing here is only 

152
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,309
submit a CodeSkulptor URL, don't submit 
your program in here. 

153
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,370
When you're happy with it, click the 
Honor Code button. 

154
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,452
Notice what that did. 
That actually highlighted this button, 

155
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:22,746
Submit for grading. 
Okay. 

156
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:26,10
So, a lot of the time I see people say, I 
can't figure out how to submit it. 

157
00:09:26,10 --> 00:09:27,760
This button, yeah, this button isn't 
highlighted for me. 

158
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,90
You have to click this box that says, I 
agree to the honor code. 

159
00:09:30,90 --> 00:09:34,963
When you're ready to submit it for 
grading, click Submit for grading. 

160
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,880
And there it is. 
We've now submitted your, submitted your 

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,62
code for grading. 
So, a couple things about submission. 

162
00:09:43,62 --> 00:09:46,29
if you decide, wow, you know, I submitted 
it early and I wanted to go back and work 

163
00:09:46,29 --> 00:09:48,738
on it some more because I realized it was 
a mistake or I was a little bit, kind of 

164
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:52,190
worried I was going to get it done in 
time. 

165
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,118
It's perfectly fine to cut an paste a new 
URL in your corresponding to a new 

166
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:58,625
assignment and resubmit it. 
There's no penalty for submitting as much 

167
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,785
as you want. 
If you're getting close to the deadline 

168
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:06,335
and you think, oh man, the deadline 
passed,Coursera has a very, very generous 

169
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:10,950
policy on late submission. 
There's a great grace period. 

170
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,290
So, if you're a couple of minutes past 
the deadline, don't panic. 

171
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,242
Just go through and submit it. 
I think most of the time, you've got a, 

172
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,160
you've got a fair bit of time to do it. 
I want to emphasize one thing. 

173
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,268
You have to click the Submit button. 
If you click Save, your project will not 

174
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:29,872
be submitted for grading. 
Saving your project does not get it 

175
00:10:29,872 --> 00:10:32,430
submitted for, for grading in pure 
assessment. 

176
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,450
This is probably the biggest thing I can 
say with this one video. 

177
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,128
Click Submit. 
If you don't click Submit, you'll be very 

178
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,901
sad when you find out that you're not 
going to be able to do peer assessment 

179
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:44,380
and get your own project assessed by your 
peers. 

180
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,929
Hit Submit. 
Okay. 

181
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,548
Now, let's go out and take a look at peer 
assessment. 

182
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:58,220
Okay, let's walk through the process of 
peer evaluation. 

183
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,285
So, an hour after the mini-project is 
due, the peer assessment page is open. 

184
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:07,630
And so, if you go back to assignment 
page, this tab will be active. 

185
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,985
And in particular, if you click on this 
link, you'll be directed to five pages, 

186
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:16,570
one with one for each of five of your 
peers. 

187
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,909
Your job would to be go through and take 
those peers projects and assess them 

188
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:23,120
based on the grading rubic that we 
provided. 

189
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,220
You'll then, be asked to evaluate your 
own project and do self assessment. 

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,820
So, if we scroll down, we're actually 
working on the first student. 

191
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,33
Now, because this is before we've 
actually started peer evaluations, this 

192
00:11:34,33 --> 00:11:38,547
box is empty, but this box will contain 
the URL for your peer's assignment. 

193
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:41,771
below, we'll have kind of a form that 
you'll need to do to actually do the 

194
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:46,70
evaluation. 
We'll ask you two questions to start. 

195
00:11:46,70 --> 00:11:48,930
What kind of operating system does your 
computer have and what kind of browser 

196
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,438
did you use, in case there's some issue 
with some of the, how your peer 

197
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:57,80
assessment actually came out. 
here are the grading instructions. 

198
00:11:57,80 --> 00:12:00,110
And this essentially kind of leads into 
the four rubric items we talked about. 

199
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,592
This is here, the first rubric item. 
If we submit a valid CodeSkulptor URL, 

200
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:07,435
and then we have some options for this, 
and then we have a place to submit some 

201
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:11,499
comments. 
So, actually, let's go through and do it. 

202
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:14,827
I actually have a URL, so I'm sitting 
here in CodeSkulptor, I'm going to paste 

203
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:17,917
it in. 
And let's hit Enter. 

204
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:24,346
And sure enough, up comes the project we 
just did, that we just created. 

205
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:27,320
So, it looks like that's a valid 
CodeSkulptor URL. 

206
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,720
So, I'm going to go through here and say 
1. 

207
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,20
And because it worked, I'm not going to 
put any comments in. 

208
00:12:32,20 --> 00:12:34,620
See, running the program does not throw 
an error. 

209
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,690
Let's do that. 
So, I'll run it. 

210
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,24
No errors, looks good. 
Let's go back and give them a 1. 

211
00:12:42,24 --> 00:12:45,700
Keep going. 
It says prints a message in the console. 

212
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,128
Yeah, printed a message in the console, 
good job. 

213
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:52,122
Okay. 
Let's keep going down. 

214
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:55,702
Last, prints the following message, we 
want a shrubbery. 

215
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,420
Okay. 
Well, let's see, run it again. 

216
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:07,232
We got, we want dot, dot, dot a shrubery. 
Hmm, uh-oh, wait a misspelled shrubbery. 

217
00:13:07,232 --> 00:13:12,980
Hmm, let's go back. 
It says, we want a shrubbery. 

218
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,680
It says, prints the specified message. 
Now, if you were having this machine 

219
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,300
graded, you'd be out of luck. 
But we're using humans. 

220
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,210
So, humans have the ability to make 
judgments. 

221
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,54
And one of the judgments is that, that 
your peers satisfy the spirit of this 

222
00:13:26,54 --> 00:13:29,654
rubric eye. 
Remember, we're all here to learn. 

223
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:34,20
So, I'm going to ask Sir Loin. 
Sir Loin, did they need the spirit of 

224
00:13:34,20 --> 00:13:37,811
this rubric item? 
Well, Sir Loin being part of King 

225
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:42,152
Arthur's round table as merciful? 
And he says yes, he did. 

226
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:46,762
So, I'm going to give him full credit. 
But, I'm going to make a note here that 

227
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:51,868
you misspelled shrubbery. 
It's always good if you're, either 

228
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:58,760
there's an issue or you take off points 
to add a comment here. 

229
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,805
Just think how it is. 
It's very frustrating if you get points 

230
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,680
marked off of your project and there's no 
reason given. 

231
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,608
So, take a few seconds and put in a 
message here, if there's some issue with 

232
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:10,856
the project on a particular item. 
then you get a chance to get some overall 

233
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:13,360
feedback here. 
Remember, this should be positive. 

234
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,730
Your goal is not to make your peers feel 
bad. 

235
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:23,720
It's to give helpful advice. 
you did a great job inside, outside of 

236
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:29,180
spelling. 
There you go. 

237
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,220
And this point now, you can submit your 
evaluation. 

238
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,100
Once you've done that, Coursera will prop 
you, prompt you to go off and do four 

239
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,620
more students, and do this same process 
of filling in forms. 

240
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,130
For most mini-projects, it should take at 
most an hour. 

241
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,668
You spend maybe 10 minutes on each one. 
That gives you, basically you have to do 

242
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:50,540
five of your peers, and then you have to 
do yourself. 

243
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,438
That's about an hour worth of work. 
the better job you do, hopefully your 

244
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:59,210
peers will do a good job on your project. 
One caveat. 

245
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:02,258
You gotta hit Submit. 
You can't get to the next projects until 

246
00:15:02,258 --> 00:15:04,649
you hit Submit. 
So doing your peers is usually pretty 

247
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,16
easy, people don't mess that up. 
But you're in a hurry to get finished, 

248
00:15:08,16 --> 00:15:11,370
and you're doing a self assessment and 
you forget to hit Submit. 

249
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,946
What happens? 
Well, Coursera says you didn't do your 

250
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,603
self assessment. 
And the way the grading is setup and we 

251
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:19,739
can't change this, this is Course, this 
is the way Coursera works, is you get a 

252
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:24,108
20% fiddle if you fail to do peer 
assessment or self assessment. 

253
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:28,352
So, please, remember to hit Submit. 
It's painful to lose 20% of your hard 

254
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:32,618
earned grade because you forget to hit 
Submit evaluation. 

255
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:35,650
Okay, go out there and give it a crack, 
our work through logistics. 

256
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,850
This isn't for a grade, so this is your 
chance to make some errors and learn how 

257
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,310
to do it correctly next week when we do 
rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. 

258
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,743
Okay, see you then.
